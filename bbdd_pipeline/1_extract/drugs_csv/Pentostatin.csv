,9848579,elimination half-life,"The five day schedule was selected because published pharmacokinetic studies had indicated that although pentostatin had an elimination half-life of approximately six hours and could inhibit plasma adenosine deaminase activity for 24 hours, recovery of enzyme activity rapidly took place and accumulation of dATP which has a toxic effect on non-replicating lymphoid cells could be increased by repeated dosing.",Phase I/II evaluation of pentostatin (2'-deoxycoformycin) in a five day schedule for the treatment of relapsed/refractory B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. ,"t1/2,β-Q60",[Article Link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9848579/),h,six,46597,DB00552,Pentostatin
